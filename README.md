Tendril investigates strategies to repossess agency over our shared present through the lenses of network infrastructure and self-production—shedding light on how emergent modes of extractivism, by removing people's insight into contemporary governance, have allowed for automation to replace politics, theory and philosophy, and with them, our say on the way we are building the world of today—ultimately seeking to chart a course away from this trajectory.

This research builds up to the Tendril Repository—an open-source collection of resources to design, manufacture and deploy your private wireless mesh network for P2P messaging. A chance to exercise a fair share of control over the fruits of your labour, the data you produce and how this data gets used, not only empowering you to understand extractivism but also offering a practical alternative to the many infrastructures complicit in perpetuating these practices.
